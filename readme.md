# **Bangkok PM2.5 Analysis** 🌆

### **Air Quality Analysis for a Healthier Bangkok** 🌟

This project is a Streamlit application that analyzes PM2.5 data from various air quality monitoring stations in Bangkok and its vicinity. The application uses K-means clustering to identify patterns in air quality data and provides insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of PM2.5 concentrations.

### **Key Features** 🔑

* **Data Loading**: Loads and preprocesses PM2.5 data from a CSV file
* **K-means Clustering**: Applies K-means clustering to identify patterns in air quality data
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualizes the results using interactive plots, including:
	+ Scatter plots to show the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations
	+ Bar charts to show the average PM2.5 concentrations by cluster
	+ Heatmaps to show the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations
* **Insights**: Provides insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of PM2.5 concentrations, including:
	+ Identification of areas with high PM2.5 concentrations
	+ Identification of times with high PM2.5 concentrations
	+ Analysis of the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and other environmental factors
